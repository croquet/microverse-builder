It is useful to be able to "elect" one peer to take a certain action
on its view side. For example, the elected view may fetch an external
data stream from internet and feed data in the shared session for all
peers.

This module provides a generic way to elect one peer. It is expected be used with another behavior modules
that actually takes an action (such as fetching data) based on the
election result.  See examples in behaviors/default/bitcoinTraker.js
and behaviors/default/flightTracker.js.

*/

/*

ElectedActor keeps all active views. Its this.views property is a Set
that retains the order of elements (viewIds), thus we can just pick
the first entry as the leader of the peers.

setup() may be called multiple times in its life cycle. So assignment
into this.views is guarded by an if statement.

*/

class ElectedActor {
    setup() {
        if (!this.views) {
            this.views = new Set();
        }
        this.subscribe(this.sessionId, "view-join", "viewJoined");
        this.subscribe(this.sessionId, "view-exit", "viewExited");
    }

    electedView() {
        for (const view of this.views) return view;
    }

    viewJoined(viewId) { this.publishViewElectedAfter(() => this.views.add(viewId)); }
    viewExited(viewId) { this.publishViewElectedAfter(() => this.views.delete(viewId)); }

        const electedBefore = this.electedView();

        if (electedBefore !== electedAfter) {
            this.say("view-elected", electedAfter);
        }
    }
}

/*

ElectedPawn publishes an event when the elected peer changes. The
electionStatusRequested() method is called when the accompanying
behavior is being setup(), so that the view can check if the view is
already elected.

For other cases, the onViewElected() method is called when the model
chooses a new leader and checks if the peer was either newly unelected
or elected. It publishes the event handleElected and handleUnelected,
and the accompanying behavior attached to the same object is expected
to handle the event.
