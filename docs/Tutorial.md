## Introduction

The Croquet Microverse is a browser-based 3D shared experience platform and OS. It includes the ability to collaboratively create 2D and 3D multi-user experiences. It runs on PCs, mobile devices including tablets and smartphones, and AR/VR devices.

This guide will enable you to quickly set up Croquet Microverse Builder and introduce you to a number of key concepts that you will need to know to create your own worlds and apps within those worlds. Not only is it easy to do this, it is incredibly fun and rewarding.

## TLDR
1. Clone the Github repository <https://github.com/croquet/microverse-builder>
    <br>(`git clone https://github.com/croquet/microverse-builder`)
2. Obtain your Croquet API Key <https://croquet.io/keys/>
3. Open a terminal and set the path to your new Microverse-Builder folder.
   <br>`cd microverse-builder`
4. Create the apiKey.js file from apiKey.js-example and the API Key above.
   <br>`cp apiKey.js-example apiKey.js # and edit apiKey.js`

In the terminal run

```npm i```

and then

```npm start```

Open browser at `localhost:9684` and enter a new world.

5. Connect to your IDE via the Watch Server.

6. Create your own worlds.

## Croquet Microverse
---

Croquet Microverse Builder is a multi-user development and deployment system built on top of the Croquet Web-based operating system. This document will get you started creating your own microverses that you can deploy anywhere you like.

The Microverse Builder IDE can be integrated directly with the tools you are already familiar with, particularly with your own editor. This enables you to directly work with and modify a live, shared Croquet Microverse session.

## Croquet OS
---
The Croquet OS is a software system for creating and deploying multiuser experiences on the web. It lets you build real-time multiuser apps without writing a single line of server code, or deploying or managing any servers. Croquet is available as a JavaScript library that grants access to our global network of public reflectors. These reflectors provide seamless cross-platform real-time interactivity to any user with a network connection and a web browser.

## Resources
---

### Croquet.io
<https://croquet.io/> is the best place to get started with what Croquet Microverse is and what it can do.

### Discord

The best resource for help in developing Croquet Microverse worlds is on our Discord server where you can ask questions, view examples, and see the Metaverse being constructed while you watch. Check it out on the [Croquet Discord server](https://discord.gg/9U9MKSbJXS).

## Steps Towards Creating Your Microverse
---

### 1. Clone the GitHub Repository

You can find the most up to date Croquet Microverse library as well as this document in the Microverse-Builder GitHub repository. Cloning this repository will give you almost everything you will need to get started creating your own Croquet Microverse.
<https://github.com/croquet/microverse-builder>

---
### 2. Obtain your API Key

Developing any Croquet application requires an API key that you can obtain from Croquet. It requires you to sign up as a developer to access this. You can sign up as a Croquet developer here:
<https://croquet.io/developers/index.html>

Select the [Sign-Up](https://croquet.io/keys/) button in the top left to create a Croquet account to get started. Once you have done that, your first key is immediately generated, and you will soon be ready to go.



---
### 3. Create the apiKey.js File
Create a file called `apiKey.js` by copying `apiKey.js-example` to `apiKey.js` and then edit the two properties called `apiKey` and `appId` in the file.

#### apiKey.js-example

```
const apiKey = "paste your apiKey from croquet.io/keys";
const appId = "type your own appId such as com.example.david.mymicroverse";
export default {apiKey, appId};

// you may export other Croquet session parameters to override default values.
```

Place your Croquet generated API keys and application ID into this and save the resulting file as apiKey.js.

#### apiKey.js
```
const apiKey = "1_a2b3c4e5f6g7h8i9j0kxyzzyqwerty142nsj6fasdsadad";
const appId = "com.example.david.mymicroverse";
export default {apiKey, appId};
```

### 4. Start Croquet Microverse

The next steps are simple. Open a terminal on your computer and change the working directory to the new microverse-builder folder. (`cd microverse-builder')

First run `npm install` in the directory.

Then run `npm start` in the same directory. This will run two servers. One is the file server on localhost:9684. The other is the watch-server that enables you to inject code changes into a running session. You can also run them separately by running `npm run file-server` and `npm run watch-server`.

You should see something similar to this:

![Croquet Console](./assets/console.png)

Not only have you completed installation of Croquet Microverse Builder, but you can run it right now to give it a try. Open your web browser and type in:

`localhost:9684`

Once you have done that, the demo world for Croquet Microverse will load and you are ready to go. The URL will change - both a new session ID and a password are autogenerated. This full URL is what allows you to share your new world with other users.

![Croquet Microverse](./assets/CroquetMicroverseBrowser.png)

Your new Microverse awaits...

### 5. The Watch Server
The watch server enables you to edit code from your own IDE and have it injected and run inside the Croquet Microverse while it is running without the need to reload. The watch server is automatically launched when execute `npm start`. You can start the watch server on its own by running `npm run watch-server`. The watch-server by default starts watching the directory called `behaviors`. If you want to create a separate set of behavior files in a different directory, you supply an argument to the watch-server by `npm run watch-server -- aDirectory`.

You can try out the live IDE now with the default world. Simply run `localhost:9684`. Once it is launched you will see a menu icon in the bottom left-hand corner. Select this and you will see a large QR code underneath which is are three menu items. `Save` and `Load` allow you to save the entire state of the world in a VRSE file (try it) and then load it back into an empty world.

![Microverse Menu](./assets/MicroverseMenu.png)

The next item, `Connect` connects directly to the watch-server. Now you can access and modify the behaviors for your world directly from the external IDE. When you save, these changes are directly injected into the world without having to reload. The image below demonstrates adding a comment to the code and having it appear (and run if it were executable) in the code viewer inside the Microverse world.

![Microverse IDE](./assets/MicroverseIDE.png)

Of course you can modify the actual executable dynamically as well. This makes development within Microverse amazingly smooth and fun.

#### Edit or add a new files
You can easily add a new file in the watched directory (by default `behaviors/default/` or your own behaviors directory), and if the file follows the standard behavior structure of other files, it will be automatically available.

### 6. Make Your Own New World
You can add a new file in the "worlds" directory (copying default.js or test.js is an easy way). If you start microverse with ?world=worldFileName, the file at `worlds/worldFileName.js` is used to start the world.

## Worlds, Cards and Behaviors
---
A Croquet World is deployed as a simple website. It is made up of a collection of cards, behaviors and 2d and 3d content. When you create a new world using Croquet Microverse Builder, every action, object and event is multiuser by default. You can think of the world you are constructing as a template. Once you deploy your Microverse and launch it, it will automatically generate a new session ID which is also added to the URL. Sharing this full URL enables other users to join the world with you any time.

### Cards

Every visible object in a Microverse is a kind of card. Some cards are flat like normal cards, and some are 3D models. We call them cards because the majority of the applications and interface objects will be flat. Also, we were inspired by Bill Atkinson's Hypercard, which demonstrated a new way of creating powerful applications. All cards are composable in that the developer can create decks made up of multiple cards that can interoperate with each other. The cards in this deck can communicate with each other using a simple publish/subscribe model call "sayDeck" and "listenDeck".

Cards can have virtually any shape. As a simple example, you can define a card using a regular SVG shape. The resulting card may be flat or can be extruded - depending on the depth property.

Cards can contain other cards - for example, a button object can be defined that is “contained” by another card. Any card can contain another card, defining a hierarchy. The bottom-level card is the root card.

Cards can manage events - users can interact with them or their leaves. For example, a slider widget is a kind of card that allows a user to drag a handle back and forth. It is self contained, but will send messages about what state the slider is in as it changes. If another card is a text display card it can scroll based upon where the slider says it is. If another user is moving the slider, then the document will scroll, but the local slider will update as well.

2D cards can have canvases. A canvas on a 2D card can itself be implemented as a full application. The canvas is texture mapped onto the card. When a user interacts with a canvas, it is via a card which forwards the event to the canvas.

A collection of cards and surfaces with a common root card define a Deck. Cards and surfaces within a deck can communicate with each other via sayDeck/listenDeck messages.

### Layers

Layers are lists of cards in the world that correspond to how the cards can be used. A card can be on multiple lists. For example, a card with the 'pointer' property responds to and can be found by pointer events. Thus they are added to the “pointer” layer. They can also, if the developer wishes, be used as a walk surface, so they would also be added to the “walk” layer.

This has the additional benefit of dramatically speeding up certain operations such as ray testing.

The current layers are:

`light` - contains the lighting of the world

`pointer` - objects that can receive events

`walk` - objects that the avatar can walk on top of

`collide` - objects that the avatar can collide with

`avatar` - contains the avatars in the world

`portal` - this card is a portal into another world

### Behaviors

Behaviors are code objects that can be applied to a card. They enable the card to interact with the user, other cards, and even the live external world. Behaviors are typically short Javascript applications that are very easy to write.

## Constructing New Worlds
---
## Tutorial 1

A number of demo worlds are included with the Microverse repository. We will use these to demonstrate how to create worlds, cards and behaviors. The first world we will visit is tutorial1.js. You can try this world out immediately once you have installed the repository and run npm start. The launch URL is:

<http://localhost:9684/?world=tutorial1>

It looks like this:

![Demoworld1](./assets/demoWorld1.png)

As you can see, this world is shared with another user. tutorial1 is made up of just three cards (not including the avatars). There is a floor card, which allows us to walk around, a light card that lets us see the world around us, and a flat card with the Croquet logo on it. The code defining this world can be found in the worlds folder in the repository. Open microverse-builder/worlds/tutorial.js to see the following code. The init function is used to define the objects that make up the world. 

The first value is Constants.AvatarNames, which specifies the name of the 3D model files in microverse-builder/assets/avatars folder. When you add your own avatars, you can simply place them in the same folder and specify their names here.

**Avatars are still under construction and will evolve rapidly as we move toward the Microverse Beta release.**

```Javascript
// Copyright 2022 by Croquet Corporation, Inc. All Rights Reserved.
// https://croquet.io
// info@croquet.io

export function init(Constants) {
    Constants.AvatarNames = [
        "newwhite", "fixmadhatter", "marchhare", "queenofhearts", "cheshirecat", "alice"
    ];
```
The next section defines the various behaviors we will be applying to our cards. The first set are system behaviors. We won't be using these until we have more sophisticated applications.

The next group are the user behaviors. These are created by the creator of the world and are applied to the cards defined later in the file.

```Javascript
    Constants.SystemBehaviorDirectory = "behaviors/croquet";
    Constants.SystemBehaviorModules = [
        "menu.js", "elected.js", "propertySheet.js"
    ];

    Constants.UserBehaviorDirectory = "behaviors/tutorial";
    Constants.UserBehaviorModules = [
        "lights.js", "gridFloor.js"
    ];
```

The final section is where we define the cards. A card is easily defined by a number of parameters including the name, type, where it is first loaded into the world, and how it will be used. Perhaps most important is we can associate a behavior to the card here. A behavior can define how a card is constructed, or how it acts when a user interacts with it, or how it can access live external data streams. Here, the first card, the "world model" is defined by the "GridFloor" module. We will take a look at that shortly. The next card defines the lighting in this world. It is a bit more sophisticated, but is relatively easy to use. The last card creates a much more card-like object. A floating object in the middle of the scene with the Croquet logo applied.

```Javascript
    Constants.DefaultCards = [
        {
            card: {
                name: "world model",
                behaviorModules: ["GridFloor"],
                layers: ["walk"],
                type: "object",
                translation:[0, -1.7, 0],
                shadow: true,
            }
        },
        {
            card: {
                name: "light",
                layers: ["light"],
                type: "lighting",
                behaviorModules: ["Light"],
                clearColor: 0xaabbff,
            }
        },
        {
            card: {
                name: "image card",
                translation: [0, 0.4, -10],
                scale: [4, 4, 4],
                type: "2d",
                textureType: "image",
                textureLocation: "./assets/images/CroquetLogo_RGB.jpg",
                frameColor: 0xcccccc,
                color: 0xffffff,
                cornerRadius: 0.05,
                depth: 0.05,
                shadow: true,
            }
        },
    ];
}
```

Let's explore the properties that are used to define the cards.

`name:` This is used to identify the card within the world and can be any string.

`behaviorModules:`  This is a list of the behaviors that will be applied to a card.

`layers:`  An array that specifies how the card will be used. Here we have one card defined as 'walk', one as 'light' and one as 'pointer'. If you wished to have a card that you could both walk on and interact with you simply specify:

`layers: ['walk', 'pointer']`

`translation: [0, -0.75, -10]` A three element array that specifies the location of the card in the world. These values are in meters. The first element is the x-coordinate, in this case it is 0 so it is in the same x-location as the avatar when it starts. The next is the y-coordinate, which indicates its height above 0. Croquet sets 0 to be the location of the avatar's camera or eye height, so -0.75 places the center of teh card at -0.75 meters beneath the eye point. The last is the z-coordinate which for Croquet and WebGL is defined as a negative value when looking into the screen. Thus, -10 will place the card 10 meters away in front of the avatar.

`scale: [4,4,4]` A three element array that defines how a card will be scaled. Cards are usually imported or defined to be contained within a 1x1x1 box for easier management.

`type: 'object'` This defines the nature of the card. Some cards are 2D objects, some 3D and there are a number of others.

`shadow: true` Specifies that this card will be both a recipient and a caster of shadows in the world. [note: we will want to separate recipient and caster into separate flags].

A full list of card properties will be available at the end of this document.

## Behaviors
---
Now let's take a look at the simple behavior we use to define the floor we are walking around on. This is the "GridFloor" behavior and is defined in the file:

"microverse-builder/behaviors/demoWorld/gridFloor.js".

This is the code:

```javascript
// Grid Floor
// Croquet Microverse
// Generates a simple gridded floor card

class GridFloorActor {
    setup() {
        // nothing to do here yet
    }
}

class GridFloorPawn {
    setup() {
        const THREE = Worldcore.THREE;
        const gridImage = './assets/images/grid.png';
        const texture = new THREE.TextureLoader().load(gridImage);
        texture.wrapS = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
        texture.wrapT = THREE.RepeatWrapping;
        texture.repeat.set( 100, 100 );

        this.floor = new THREE.Mesh(
            new THREE.BoxGeometry( 100, 1, 100, 1, 1, 1 ),
            new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture, color: 0xcccccc }));
        this.floor.receiveShadow = true;
        this.shape.add(this.floor);
    }
}

export default {
    modules: [
        {
            name: "GridFloor",
            actorBehaviors: [GridFloorActor],
            pawnBehaviors: [GridFloorPawn],
        }
    ]
}
```

It is a very simple behavior. The major part of the system is to construct the 3D floor and apply a grid to it. You may recognize that it uses the Three.js 3D rendering system.

There are three parts to this behavior. The first is what we call the "actor". In Croquet, the actor is the replicated state of the object - the part that Croquet guarantees is exactly the same on every users machines at all times. In this case, the GridFloorActor doesn't have much to do to keep things in sync and is really just a placeholder.

The second part is what we call the "pawn". As might be clear from its name, it is controlled by the actor and it's job is to represent the state of the actor as the actor is updated - whether from the local user or a remote user. In this case, the only job of the GridFloorPawn is to construct something for us to stand on. As you can see, the floor is simply a three.js BoxGeometry with a grid texture applied to it.

The last part of the behavior code is simply bundling the actor and pawn behaviors into an exportable module that can then be added to the card when we create that.

---

## Tutorial 2
In this next tutorial, we will load a 3D model of a gallery where we will place a number of objects. We will also define a number of new behaviors that will add a simple interaction to the objects in that world.

The launch URL is:

http://localhost:9684/?world=tutorial2

Here is an image of the world we will be constructing:

![Tutorial 2](./docs/assets/Tutorial2.png)

There are a number of additional cards defined in this world, but everything is still quite simple. Let's start with the definition of the gallery.

```javascript
    const frameColor = 0x888888;

    Constants.DefaultCards = [
        {
            card: {
                name:"world model",
                type: "3d",
                dataLocation: "./assets/3D/artgallery_042122.glb.zip",
                dataScale:[1,1,1],
                singleSided: true,
                shadow: true,
                layers: ["walk"],
                translation:[0, -1.7, 0],
                shadow: true,

                placeholder: true,
                placeholderSize: [100, 0.01, 100],
                placeholderColor: 0xcccccc,
                placeholderOffset: [0, -1.7, 0],
            }
        },

```

As you can see, this is a bit more complex than the previous creation of the simple grid floor, but not that much.

```javascript
type: "3d",
dataLocation: "./assets/3D/artgallery_042122.glb.zip",
dataScale:[1,1,1],
```

The most important change is we are now referencing a 3D model that is in our assets' folder. This is the model of the gallery and was originally created in Blender and exported as a single GLB file including textures. It was then zipped for faster transfer.

We also specify that the type is "3d", so that the file loader has some hint of how to manage it. 

We set dataScale: to [1,1,1] as that tells the importer that one unit in the model corresponds to one unit in the world - in this case, both are in meters.

The placeholder fields are there to define a floor to allow the avatars to walk around while the rest of the scene is loading. The placeholder is just a version of the grid floor we saw in Tutorial 1. We define the size, color and offset of the floor here.

The next two cards - the light card and the image card are exactly the same.

```javascript
{
    card: {
        name: "light",
        layers: ["light"],
        type: "lighting",
        behaviorModules: ["Light"],
        dataLocation: "./assets/sky/shanghai_riverside_2k.exr",
        dataType: "exr",
    }
},
{
    card: {
        name: "image card",
        translation: [0, 0.4, -10],
        //rotation: [0, Math.PI / 2, 0],
        scale: [4, 4, 4],
        type: "2d",
        textureType: "image",
        textureLocation: "./assets/images/CroquetLogo_RGB.jpg",
        fullBright: true,
        frameColor: 0xcccccc,
        color: 0xbbbbbb,
        cornerRadius: 0.05,
        depth: 0.05,
        shadow: true,
    }
},
```

The two new cards are different however. The first card is the "Joe the Box" card which is defined by a behavior similar to the grid floor that we saw earlier. The second box is loaded from the 3D assets in the same way that the gallery itself was loaded.

```javascript
{
    card: {
        name:"Joe the Box",
        behaviorModules: ["JoeTheBox"],
        layers: ["pointer"],
        type: "object",
        translation:[-4, 0.4, -10],
        //rotation:[0, Math.pi/4, 0],
        shadow: true,
    }
},     
{
    card: {
        name:"Imported Box",
        type: "3d",
        dataLocation: "./assets/3D/testcube_1m.glb.zip",
        layers: ["pointer"],
        translation:[4, 0.4, -10],
        dataScale:[1,1,1],
        //rotation:[0, Math.pi/4, 0],
        shadow: true,
    }
},     

```

## Actor/Pawn Relationship

An actor is a type of model that automatically instantiates a matching pawn in the view when its created. This means you can focus on what the actor does, and how the pawn looks, without having to worry about how they communicate with each other.

## Note on Persistence
The system stores the "persistent data" about every 60 seconds if there is some activity in the world. When you edit your behavior code, or update the system, Croquet starts a fresh session but re-loads contents from the persistent data. The content in the world file that the world is originally created from is not used to initialize this new session. Consider the world file as the starting point of a world, but editing it does not affect the world once it is created unless you edit it live by connecting as above.

## Croquet Microverse References
Croquet Microverse is built on top of a number of other systems. The most important is the Croquet OS and the Croquet Worldcore framework. It isn't essential that you be familiar with these but you may find them useful in understanding the basis of how Croquet Microverse operates.

[Croquet Documentation Main Page](https://croquet.io/docs/)

The [Croquet OS kernel](https://croquet.io/docs/croquet/) is an extremely low-latency multi-user replicated computation platform.

The [Croquet Worldcore framework](https://croquet.io/docs/worldcore/) defines the actor/pawn architecture underlying the Croquet Metaverse cards.

[Three.js](https://threejs.org) provides the 3D rendering framework. It is an extremely powerful, flexible and well-defined library.

Croquet Microverse utilizes the [Rapier Physics Engine](https://rapier.rs/). Written in Rust and running in WebAssembly, Rapier is an open source, very high-performance but easy to create multiuser, interactive physics simulations.
